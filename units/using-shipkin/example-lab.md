# Example lab

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the 
animals is case they ever got off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene 
that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals 
can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually 
supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.
